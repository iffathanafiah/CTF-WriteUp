# [WEB] Warmup

Walkthrough


When opening the website, you will be greeted with a blank page containing “Warm Up” text.

See the page source; there is some clue when you include ?source inside the website link.

🔍Clue:

The code will get what we put in the link “?warmup=anything” (in this case it will get
anything and insert into $string1) and it will compare with $string2.

>If there is $string2 inside the $string1, it will be replaced with ' ' which will remove the same
string as in $string2 and insert it into $string3.
>
>If $string3 is equal in value and type (===) with $string2, it will call the warmup_fucntion();
( yes, it was misspelled ) and maybe it will print the flag that we have been searching for.

So, for the solution, I try to let the link as below:

**?warmup=warmupiswarmupisessentialessential**

It will show us the flag.
